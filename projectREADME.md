# Final Project: How has the Demand for Computer Science Jobs Changed in the Last 50 Years?

I answered this question by finding the change in various computer science job fields, their income, and the amount of bachelor and master degress handed out every year.

With this data, I was able to draw several conclusions about the computer science industry and can predict what the future of the industry will entail.

Please draw your own conclusions as well of what this data may mean and what the future of computer science will be.
